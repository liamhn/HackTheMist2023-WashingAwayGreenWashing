According to Dollarama CEO Neil Rossy, the initiative makes the company one of the first Canadian retailers to integrate ESG targets into credit agreements. Rossy added: “This marks another important step in our ESG journey, as we pursue our growth strategy and seek to create sustainable value for our stakeholders.” The sustainability-linked loan is tied to two specific goals related to the company’s overall ESG strategy, including climate change and energy management to reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity, and a diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) target to increase the female gender representation in management positions. Dollarama’s ESG goals include reducing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030, and maintaining at least 40% female representation in management level positions. J.P. Towner, Chief Financial Officer, said: “The conversion to sustainability-linked credit facilities is a concrete example of Dollarama’s continued efforts to meaningfully integrate our ESG strategy and commitments into everyday decision-making, including in the active management of our capital structure.” Emanuela Kerencheva Emanuela Kerencheva a Senior Student at the American University in Bulgaria majoring in Journalism and Mass Communications and Business Administration.
