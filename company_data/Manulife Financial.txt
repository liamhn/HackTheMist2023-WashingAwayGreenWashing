We are taking steps to reduce our environmental footprint, support the transition to a net zero future, and invest in climate change mitigation and resilience. Read more on our Climate Approach Our climate approach Operations: Substantially reducing emissions to lessen our footprint Our substantial natural resource holdings have enabled us to realize net zero operations, meaning we remove more carbon from the atmosphere than our business operations emit. We are committed to reducing our absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions 35% by 2035. Investments: Actively investing for a sustainable future We acknowledge the important role continued progress on financed emissions will have on our enterprise-wide climate impact. We are committed to steering our investment portfolio to be net zero by 2050. We are taking a sector-based approach to assess our own investments, focusing first on heavy-emitting industries, such as power generation. We have committed to the Science Based Targets initiative, to guide and validate our target setting, measurement and progress reporting. We will continue to grow our $39.8 billion portfolio of green investments, including renewable energy and energy-efficient buildings.
