We have a responsibility to help address this global challenge by reducing emissions at our operations and in our value chain and by sustainably producing the metals, minerals and energy that are essential for building the technologies and infrastructure needed to transition to a low-carbon economy. Home Sustainability Climate Change OUR NET ZERO VISION We are focused on supplying the critical resources needed to build a low-carbon future, including rebalancing our portfolio towards copper , the most needed mineral for a net-zero world. OUR NET ZERO GOALS Our goal is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 across all aspects of our business and activities. Our Climate Strategy 2025 Achieve Net-Zero SCOPE 2 EMISSIONS 2025 Achieve Net-Zero SCOPE 2 EMISSIONS Replace the equivalent of 1,000 internal combustion engine vehicles from our fleets with zero-emission transportation alternatives. 2030 Reduce Carbon Intensity Of OUR OPERATIONS BY 33%* 2030 Reduce Carbon Intensity Of OUR OPERATIONS BY 33%* Support partners in reducing global carbon intensity of steelmaking by 30%. Establish low-emission supply chain corridors, including support for a 40% reduction in shipping emission intensity, working with customers and transportation providers. *Based on 2020 baseline. 2050 Achieve Net-Zero EMISSIONS 2050 Achieve Net-Zero EMISSIONS Ambition to achieve net-zero Scope 3 emissions. Scope 1 and 2 Emissions Operational GHG emissions, which include emissions from energy sources owned and operated by Teck and emissions related to the generation of purchased electricity used by Teck. Scope 3 Emissions GHG emissions from sources owned or controlled by other entities downstream of our value chain including the transportation and use of our products. OUR PATHWAY TO NET ZERO To achieve net-zero GHG emissions across our operations and throughout our supply chain , we will implement a range of abatement options including renewable energy use, electrification, carbon capture, carbon offsets, and more. *Scope 1 and 2 Emissions Filter By Category All Coal & Natural Gas Offsets & Removals Electricity Fugitive Methane Diesel Scope 3 All Coal & Natural Gas Offsets & Removals Electricity Fugitive Methane Diesel Scope 3 Years Range From 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 To 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Reset Filters 2019 Piloting and adopting smaller zero emissions vehicles (e.g. Electric Buses) 2020 Contracted 50% of operational energy at QB2 from renewable sources Sourcing 100% renewable energy at Carmen de Andacollo 2021 Employ energy efficient bulk carriers for shipments of steelmaking coal (November 2021) Evaluating the elimination of fossil-fuel power dryers at our steelmaking coal operations Exploring the potential use of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) 2022 Advance Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) pilot project at Trail Operations Agreement with Caterpillar to deploy 30 zero-emissions large haul trucks by 2030 Teck to pilot electric transport truck at Highland Valley Copper Operations 2023 Complete First Nature-Based Solutions Offset Project Assessing fugitive methane emissions Pilot CCUS 2024 2025 Net-zero Scope 2 emissions Contracting 100% of operational energy at QB2 from renewable sources Field Test Early-Learner Haul Truck with Caterpillar 2026 2027 Begin transition to zero-emission coal drying Begin deployment of 30 Caterpillar zero-emission trucks 2028 2029 2030 33% intensity reduction Reset filters Teck is already one of the world’s lowest carbon-intensity producers of copper, zinc, steelmaking coal and energy.
