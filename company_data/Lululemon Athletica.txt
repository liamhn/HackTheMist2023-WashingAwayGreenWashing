The apparel industry contributes to this problem, and that needs to change. We’re working toward a carbon-neutral future, starting with cutting our own emissions across our value chain and supporting a global movement for action. Our climate strategy addresses carbon emissions across our owned and operated facilities (scope 1 and 2) and our supply chain (scope 3) with a focus on increasing efficiency, transitioning toward renewable energy, investing in raw material innovation, and collaborating across industries for progress. Our commitments include: Renewable electricity: 100% renewable electricity for our owned and operated facilities by 2021 Science-based targets: 60% absolute reduction of GHG emissions in all owned and operated facilities by 2030 (2018 base year) 60% intensity reduction of GHG emissions across our global supply chain* by 2030 (2018 base year) Science-based targets help to align our goals with the Paris Climate Agreement – to limit global warming to well-below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. We intend to achieve progress through four strategies that deliver emissions reductions: sourcing renewable electricity in our operations through a combination of renewable energy credits (RECs) and a virtual Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) in North America engaging with our manufacturing partners for energy efficiency and renewable energy progress, sourcing more sustainable raw materials and fibers, including recycled and renewable content polyester and nylon, and reducing carbon emissions in our inbound logistics. As part of our renewable energy strategy, we have joined The Climate Group’s RE100 , a partnership of influential businesses increasing corporate demand and supply of renewable energy. In addition, we have signed the UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, an industry-wide initiative that works collectively to reduce carbon emissions across the fashion and broader textile sectors. We are celebrating and building on our energy efficiency projects to date including LED lighting in stores and distribution centers, purchasing renewable energy, and implementing an operational energy tracking system. Since 2011, we have reported our carbon footprint to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), an international investor facing not-for-profit organization. *Includes purchased goods & services and upstream transportation & distribution.
