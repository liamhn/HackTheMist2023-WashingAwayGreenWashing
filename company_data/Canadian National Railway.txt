Our carbon footprint covers our rail locomotive fleet, non-rail vehicle and vessel fleets, and buildings and yards. With 85% of our GHG emissions generated from rail operations, we believe the single best way we can positively impact the environment is by continuously improving our locomotive operating efficiency and reducing our carbon footprint. Download the latest CDP report Download the GHG Emissions Assurance Statement Our Performance GHG Emissions Intensity Reduction 40% reduction of locomotive carbon emissions intensity since 1993 One of the Industry Leaders in Rail Fuel Efficiency 15% less fuel per gross ton mile than industry average Non-Rail Carbon Reduction 33% carbon reduction from electricity at key yards since 2011 Reducing our Rail Carbon Footprint Over the years, the pursuit of efficiency has been the hallmark of our success. With Precision Railroading, fuel efficient locomotives, leading edge technology and numerous other programs, we achieved a fuel and carbon efficiency improvement of 40% over the past 25 years. Using fewer rail cars and locomotives to ship more freight Promoting fuel conservation practices Driving efficiency across the supply chain Deploying leading edge technologies Operating through efficient routing protocols Optimizing yard performance Upgrading our locomotive fleet Reducing Our Non-Rail Carbon Footprint Building on our industry leading rail fuel efficiency programs, we continue to extend the same efficiency mindset to our non-rail fleet including our intermodal equipment and trucking fleet, On Company Service (OCS) vehicles and our Great Lakes shipping vessels. Together, they represent 9% of our total carbon footprint. Improving Efficiency at Our Building and Yards Our buildings and yards account for approximately 7% of our carbon emissions, comprising electricity, natural gas and miscellaneous fuel consumption. We are committed to improving the use of energy in our existing buildings and yards, while integrating more sustainable designs into new buildings.
