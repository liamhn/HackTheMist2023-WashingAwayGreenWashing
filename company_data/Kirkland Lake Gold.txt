Humidity We base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night. Kirkland Lake experiences some seasonal variation in the perceived humidity. The muggier period of the year lasts for 3.5 months , from June 4 to September 19 , during which time the comfort level is muggy , oppressive , or miserable at least 3% of the time. The month with the most muggy days in Kirkland Lake is July , with 3.2 days that are muggy or worse. The least muggy day of the year is March 1 , when muggy conditions are essentially unheard of.

Methodology For each hour between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. of each day in the analysis period (1980 to 2016), independent scores are computed for perceived temperature, cloud cover, and total precipitation. Those scores are combined into a single hourly composite score, which is then aggregated into days, averaged over all the years in the analysis period, and smoothed. Our cloud cover score is 10 for fully clear skies, falling linearly to 9 for mostly clear skies, and to 1 for fully overcast skies. Our precipitation score , which is based on the three-hour precipitation centered on the hour in question, is 10 for no precipitation, falling linearly to 9 for trace precipitation, and to 0 for 1 millimetre of precipitation or more. Our tourism temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 10 °C , rising linearly to 9 for 18 °C , to 10 for 24 °C , falling linearly to 9 for 27 °C , and to 1 for 32 °C or hotter. Our beach/pool temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 18 °C , rising linearly to 9 for 24 °C , to 10 for 28 °C , falling linearly to 9 for 32 °C , and to 1 for 38 °C or hotter. Growing Season Definitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 0 °C) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere). The growing season in Kirkland Lake typically lasts for 4.0 months ( 124 days ), from around May 24 to around September 25 , rarely starting before May 6 or after June 10 , and rarely ending before September 6 or after October 14 .

The black line is the percentage chance that a given day is within the growing season. Growing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 10 °C and a cap of 30 °C . Based on growing degree days alone, the first spring blooms in Kirkland Lake should appear around May 14 , only rarely appearing before May 4 or after May 27 .

Solar Energy This section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation. The average daily incident shortwave solar energy experiences extreme seasonal variation over the course of the year. The brighter period of the year lasts for 3.7 months , from April 29 to August 19 , with an average daily incident shortwave energy per square meter above 5.3 kWh . The brightest month of the year in Kirkland Lake is June , with an average of 6.2 kWh . The darker period of the year lasts for 3.6 months , from October 25 to February 13 , with an average daily incident shortwave energy per square meter below 2.0 kWh . The darkest month of the year in Kirkland Lake is December , with an average of 0.9 kWh .

Data Sources This report illustrates the typical weather in Kirkland Lake, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016. Temperature and Dew Point There are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Kirkland Lake. For each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Kirkland Lake according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations. The estimated value at Kirkland Lake is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Kirkland Lake and a given station. The stations contributing to this reconstruction are: Kirkland Lake Airport (CXKI, 100%, 2.9 km, east, 3 m elevation change) Timmins/Victor M. Power Airport (CYTS, 0.4%, 110 km, northwest, -27 m elevation change) CXKI, 100% 3 km, 3 m CYTS, 0% 110 km, -27 m © OpenStreetMap contributors To get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Kirkland Lake and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data. Other Data All data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus. All other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid. Land Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Elevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Names, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database . Time zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .

Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site. We draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands. We further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.
